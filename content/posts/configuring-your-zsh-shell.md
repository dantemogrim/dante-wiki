## Custom Prompt (macOS)

If you already have a **.zshrc** file in your Home folder already, open it up in your code editor:
```shell
$ code . .zshrc
```

If you don't, create one by heading over to your home folder and run the following command:
```shell
$ touch .zshrc
```

_Output your device's name:_

**.zshrc**
```shell
PROMPT='%B%F{51}%m:%f%b'
```
_Give your prompt an emoji:_

**.zshrc**
```shell
PROMPT='üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è '
```
