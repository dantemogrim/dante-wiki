### |

Shorthand version `OR`, described below.

### ..

If you want to search for a number between a range of numbers, place your two periods between that range.
Just as I'm using `â‚¬`, the `$` sign can also be applied.

**Example:** `macbook â‚¬50..â‚¬500`

---

### " "

Surround your search within quotation marks to get an exact match of a word or phrase.

**Example:** `"world's first computer"`

### ()

Put a search term between parenthesis to group commands.

**Example:** `(zero w OR pico) raspberry pi`

---

### AND

Placed between two words if ou want your results to include both.

**Example:** `accessibility AND a11y`

---

### AROUND(X)

Search for two words that are within (X) words from each other.

**Example:** `php AROUND(2) books`

---

### cache:

Good for identifying when a page was last crawled.

Hot tip when looking for documentation.

### movie:

Show information about a specific movie.
If it's currently playing at movie theaters, you'll be able to see showtimes near you.

**Example:** `movie:hackers`

---

### OR

Returns results related two one of the words or both.
