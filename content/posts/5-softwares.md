I love softwares. Here's a list of ones I am currently using:

### Audio
- **Audacity** - _Audio editing._
- **Blackhole** - _Rerouting your computer's audio (might require some experience)._
- **SoundSource** _Gives you more better control/access over all the audio on your Mac._

### Color Pickers
- **ColorSlurp**

### Compressors
- **Handbrake** _Super effective video compressor._
- **ImageAlpha** - Image optimizer.
- **ImageOptim**

### Kanban
- **Things3**

### Images
- **Affinity Designer** - _SVG creation/editing_
- **Pixelmator Pro** - _Similar to Photoshop but for a reasonable price._

### Other
- **Amphetamine** - _Prevents your Mac from falling asleep._
- **CheatSheet** - _Hold `Cmd` to list all available shortcuts on the software you're currently in._
- **CountdownBar** - _Appears in the top menu bar and counts down the days until a deadline._
- **Quitter** - _Automatically shuts down apps for you, after they've been inactive during a specified amount of time._
- **Rectangle**

### Rinsing
- **AppCleaner**
- **ExifCleaner**
- **OmniDiskSweeper**
- **Onyx**

### Writing
- **Obsidian** _(My main note taking app.)_

Do you have any recommendations I should be looking into? Let me know!
